# Elevator Position Estimation Using 1D Kalman Filter

1D Kalman Filter for elevator position estimation. Includes data generation, kalman filter implementation using `filterpy` and my own, plus an animation with `matplotlib`. Everything is inside `main.ipynb`.

Developed for the Robotic Perception class at Toyohashi University of Tecnology.
